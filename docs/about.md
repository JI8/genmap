# AImaps

AImaps is an experimental web application that combines AI capabilities with mapping technology to help users discover interesting locations around the world in a unique way.

## Overview

The application allows users to input natural language queries about places, and an AI model interprets these queries to suggest relevant geographic coordinates. These locations are then displayed on an interactive map.

### Example Queries
- "Where are the most dramatic pointy rock formations?"
- "What's a perfect place for a peaceful beach vacation?"
- "Where can I find the world's most ancient trees?"
- "Which location has the most spectacular waterfalls?"
- "Where are the most picturesque mountain villages?"

## How it Works

1. Users enter a natural language query about a place or type of location
2. The AI model processes the query and returns relevant coordinates
3. The coordinates are displayed on an interactive map interface

Note: While the coordinates provided are meant for discovery and exploration, they should not be used as the sole reference for navigation purposes.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend Framework: Next.js
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Deployment: Vercel
- APIs:
  - Maps API for visualization
  - OpenAI for location interpretation

## Purpose

This project serves as both a fun experiment and a practical tool for:
- Discovering new places through AI interpretation
- Exploring locations from unique perspectives
- Finding interesting destinations based on natural descriptions
- Experiencing geography through the "eyes" of an AI model
